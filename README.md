# Solar-installation project
# Overview
A solar installation project consisting of a 2.5kVA inverter, 8 x 200Watts solar panels, a 60A charge controller, and 2 x 220Ah tubular batteries.

# System Components
- Inverter:- 2.5kVA 24V
- Solar Panels:- 8 x 200W
- Charge Controller:- 60A
- Batteries:- 2 x 220Ah tubular batteries

# System Configuration
- Solar Panel Configuration:- 8 panels connected in parallel
- Battery Configuration:- 2 batteries connected in parallel

# Installation Guide
The solar panels was mounted on the roof facing the sun's path in the sky to capture the sun's rays. The +ve and -ve wires from the solar panels was Connected to the +ve and -ve terminal of the charge controller respectively with DC Breaker and DC surge protector was installed between the panels and the charge controller to protect the setup from overload, short circuits and thunder strike. And the charge controller was connectedto the batteries. And lastly the batteries was connected to the inverter.
(NOTE: CONNECT THE BATTERIES TO THE CHARGE CONTROLLER FIRST BEFORE THE PANELS)
The inverter was configured according to the manufacturer's instructions.

# Maintenance Schedule
- Quarterly:- Check the solar panels connection and cleaning the panel surface, and also check the batteries terminals and tighten any loose connections.
- Annually:- Perform a thorough system inspection and replace any worn-out components.
